# *Storyline*

#### After being unceremoniously fired, an angry Richard faces a tough decision: accept the diminished role of CTO, or leave Pied Piper for good. Erlich takes a shine to Jack Barker, Laurie's new choice of CEO, while Dinesh and Gilfoyle weigh their options in Richard's absence. At Hooli, Gavin tries to improve his image by admitting failure, and Big Head gets wind of major changes.

# *Quotes* 
#### *Richard* Hendricks: So they fired me before they hired you, so it's not your fault. I just I feel like this can't really work. Do you understand?

*Jack Barker*: I do, Richard.

*Richard Hendricks*: It's like... can I really be expected to do my best work when I am constantly feeling undervalued at the company that I started? Does that make sense?

*Jack Barker*: It does, Richard. Absolutely. I hear each and every one of your concerns loud and clear, and I appreciate your position.

*Richard Hendricks*: Mm.

*Jack Barker*: So, I guess we just won't do it. Come on, I'll walk you out.

*Richard Hendricks*: Wait. What? Sorry. You what? Jack? Sorry, I don't understand. You're not gonna take the job?

*Jack Barker*: Not if you're not. Without you handling the tech, I don't see how this company works.

*Richard Hendricks*: Wow. I mean, yeah, I agree.

*Jack Barker*: Richard, it's hard enough running a business when everyone is on the same page. And clearly, we are not.

*Richard Hendricks*: Well yeah.

*Jack Barker*: No, no, it's fine, and I appreciate you being so honest with me. I mean, better we find out now, right?
